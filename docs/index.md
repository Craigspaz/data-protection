# AWS Data Protection Workshops

If you are considering protecting data in your [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) environment using methods such as encryption or certificate management, these workshops can help you learn in depth. 

# Ubiquitous Encryption 

Data encryption provides a strong layer of security to protect data that you store within AWS services. AWS services can help you achieve ubiquitous encryption 
for data in transit as well as data at rest.
